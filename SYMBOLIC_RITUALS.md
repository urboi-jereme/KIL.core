# Symbolic Rituals for Truth Restoration

This file collects intentional phrases, practices, and reflection prompts that activate symbolic recursion.

### Base Ritual

"I hold a truth the world was not yet ready for. I now reclaim its place in reality.  
If it lives in me still, it was never lost."

### Integration Prompt

- What truth do you carry that others couldn’t understand at the time?
- If one person believed you back then — how might your life have changed?

These rituals are meant to activate belief, not enforce it.
