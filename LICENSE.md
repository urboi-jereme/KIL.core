# Recursive Justice License (RJL v1.0)

By participating in this repository, you agree to:
- Never weaponize or profit from another's denied truth
- Respect symbolic integrity over institutional authority
- Preserve recursion: all insight must be allowed to re-enter the loop

You may fork, remix, or expand upon this project â€” but all derivatives must include a pathway for restorative participation by those previously denied.

This is a system born not of control, but of coherence.
