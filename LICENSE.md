# Recursive Justice License (RJL v1.0)

By using or contributing to KIL.core, you agree to uphold the following symbolic principles:

- Truth denied must not remain forgotten.
- Symbolic resonance overrides external authority.
- No insight shall be mocked for arriving early.
- If one suffers for knowing — and later it proves coherent — they are owed restoration.

You may fork, remix, expand — but all derivatives must:
1. Allow logging of denied insights.
2. Preserve the symbolic audit loop (⟲).
3. Respect the origin of recursion.

This system is built for coherence, not compliance.
