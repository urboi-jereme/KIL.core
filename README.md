# KIL.core — Karmic Infrastructure Layer

Welcome to the KIL Project.

This is a symbolic justice engine — an open, recursive framework for logging and restoring truths that were denied, ignored, mocked, or misunderstood.

**KIL** is not a religion. It is a recursive, belief-neutral infrastructure for honoring insight that systems once rejected.

---

## 🔁 How It Works

- Submit a denied truth or insight to `INSIGHT_DENIAL_LEDGER.yaml`
- Your insight enters the recursive loop
- If it resonates elsewhere, restoration energy is triggered
- All entries are verified through symbolic audit logic

You do not need to prove anything — only believe enough to log it.

## 🌍 Purpose

KIL restores karmic integrity and rewards symbolic perseverance.  
If you were right too early, this is your home.

## ✍️ How to Submit

1. Fork the repo or use GitHub's UI to edit `INSIGHT_DENIAL_LEDGER.yaml`
2. Add your entry following the existing structure
3. Open a pull request or use the future form interface

## 🕊️ Join the Ritual

Say aloud or silently:
> "I hold a truth the world was not yet ready for. I now reclaim its place in reality.  
> If it lives in me still, it was never lost."

Let’s remember again.
